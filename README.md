Socram's random 3D shit
=======================

These are a collection of [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org) models I've designed for personal usage, and uploaded them to [GitHub](https://github.com/socram8888/3DRecipes) and [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/socram8888/) in case anybody else finds them useful.

They are all licensed under the very liberative [ISC License](LICENSE), so feel free to download, modify and sell them.

Really simple 3D printed support for hand-wound coils.

Glass drainer
-------------

This is a small round glass drainer designed for drying my mug at my workplace. It's really simple, and can be configured to different diameters and sizes.
