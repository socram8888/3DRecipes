Socram's random 3D shit
=======================

These are a collection of [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org) models I've designed for personal usage, and uploaded them to [GitHub](https://github.com/socram8888/3DRecipes) and [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/socram8888/) in case anybody else finds them useful.

This is a quick and dirt name tag that clips on water bottles, for storing them on a shared fridge at my workplace.

Glass drainer
-------------

This is a small round glass drainer designed for drying my mug at my workplace. It's really simple, and can be configured to different diameters and sizes.
